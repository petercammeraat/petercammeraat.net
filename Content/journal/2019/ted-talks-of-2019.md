### 5 tips to improve your critical thinking

> Every day, a sea of decisions stretches before us. Some are small and unimportant, but others have a larger impact on our lives. For example, which politician should I vote for? Should I try the latest diet craze? Or will email make me a millionaire? We're bombarded with so many decisions that it's impossible to make a perfect choice every time. But there are many ways to improve our chances, and one particularly effective technique is critical thinking.

1. formulate your question
2. gather your information
3. apply the information
4. consider the implications
5. explore other points of view

### It is not about privacy -- it is about power

> The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal is not about privacy -- it is about power, says journalist Carole Cadwalladr. In conversation with TED Global Curator Bruno Giussani, Cadwalladr discusses the latest on her reporting on the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal -- and what we still don't know about the transatlantic links between Brexit and the 2016 US presidential election. "Who has the information, who has the data about you, that is where power now lies," Cadwalladr says.
