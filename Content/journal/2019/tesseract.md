> A cube is one of the simplest solids one can imagine. Over the course of this article I’ll try to explain how to expand it to the next dimension to obtain a tesseract – a 4D equivalent of a cube.

> The concept of a four dimensional cube may be a bit overwhelming, but by the time we’re done it should hopefully become more clear what the demonstration below is all about. You can drag the object around to view it from a different angle.

Awesome explanation of Tesseract. I am a big fan of Bartosz Ciechanowski work, his explanations are clear and have cool interactive examples.
