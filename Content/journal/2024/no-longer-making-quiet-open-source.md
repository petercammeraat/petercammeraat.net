A while ago I wrote about making [Quiet open source](/journal/2024/making-quiet-open-source/). I've been getting quite a few emails from other indie app developers lately, who, like me, decided to make their apps open source but later wished they hadn't. 

They've been sharing their experiences and warning against it, mainly because of all the extra stress and problems it brought them. After thinking it over, I've decided to take their advice and I am no longer making Quiet open source, but keep it a closed-source project.
