### New app icon

After 7 (almost 8) years it was really time for a new app icon for Quiet. Check it out! A beautiful new colour calming mix of green/blue, a bubble for you to be in, and waves that symbolises the constant never ending distractions in everyday life.

Nice layered app icon for visionOS:

    There should have been a video here but your browser does not seem
    to support it.
</video>

I absolutely love it and I hope you do to.

This app icon is all thanks to, the master in app icon design, [Matthew Skiles](https://www.matthewskiles.com). If you ever need an app icon, I highly recommend him.



### visionOS support

After macOS, iOS, and iPadOS; visionOS will be the 4th platform Quiet works on. Love the glass looks, how the tabbar works. And how easy it was to add visionOS support to Quiet. 

Pictures and words do not say enough. So here is a video:
