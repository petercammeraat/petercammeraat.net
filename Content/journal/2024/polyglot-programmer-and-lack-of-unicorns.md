> Polyglot programmers exist, but good ones are like unicorns. They’re nearly impossible to find and when you do find them they’re insanely high in demand and very expensive. I know, I’ve been down this exact road before.

> If you have a great multiplatform tool, usually these issues are few and far between, but I’ve run into enough of these issues with various different multiplatform tools that it has become a royal pain in the ass work around at times. Absolutely frustrating when it happens. Its times like that when I wish I had used the right tool for the right job. Maybe Swift for iOS or JavaScript/HTML for web stuff, or some back end server tech and not some other tool thats pretending to do the work of another tool.

> Ultimately what this feels like is that you’re shoving a square peg into a round hole because things just don’t feel right, but you’re using tool X so you have to do it that way. Many people feel this way and its part of the human nature of it. Apply enough force, hit it hard enough with a hammer and it will go in, but it doesn’t mean that it will be pretty or fun in the end.

I am not a polygot programmer and never will be one. I love programming in Swift and the rich API's that are available in the ecosystem. Everyday I discover something new. I also believe in using the right tool for the right job.

The whole article is worth the read and not per se about Kotlin Multiplatform.
