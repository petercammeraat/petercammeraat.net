Hey there! As we step into 2024, I'm excited to share my plans for diving deeper into Swift development and making some cool stuff open source. I want to make Quiet open source, inviting everyone to join in and make it even better together.

Will be working on creating several open-source Swift packages. One of these packages will be a static site generator. Imagine a tool that helps make static websites using Swift, it's something I'm eager to build and share with fellow developers.

But I'm not stopping there. I'm keen on exploring what else we can do with Swift. Here are a few areas I'm excited about:

1. Swift for Servers: Swift isn't just for apps; it can also be great for building server systems. I want to help create tools and frameworks that make it easier for developers to use Swift on the server side.
2. Swift in Embedded Systems: Think about tiny devices in smart homes or gadgets. Swift could be handy there too. I'm planning to explore how we can use Swift for these embedded systems.
3. Swift on Windows: Yep, making Swift work smoothly on Windows is another thing on my radar. Making it more accessible to a wider audience of developers is important to me.
4. Swift and Web Assembly: This is about making Swift work well inside web browsers. It's a bit of a challenge, but I'm interested in exploring how Swift can play a role here.
5. Swift on Android: We all know Android uses a different language, but what if Swift could work there too? That's something I'm curious about and eager to dive into.

So, in simple terms, I'm all about making Swift more versatile and widely used by working on these open-source projects. I believe that when people team up and share ideas, we can create some pretty awesome stuff.

I'll be sharing updates on these projects as they progress. And hey, if you're into Swift or just curious, feel free to join in! Let's make 2024 a year where Swift becomes even more exciting and accessible for everyone.

As an additional challenge I'm taking on: the [100 Days to Offload challenge](https://100daystooffload.com). In a nutshell, I'll be embarking on a journey to craft 100 blog posts within the span of a year.

This challenge is a personal commitment to consistent learning, sharing, and contributing to the vibrant community of knowledge-seekers. Over the course of the next 365 days, I'll be penning down thoughts, insights, and discoveries related to Swift, open-source projects, and the ever-evolving landscape of software.
