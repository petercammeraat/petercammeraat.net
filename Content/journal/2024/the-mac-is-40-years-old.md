On this day 40 years ago (24 January 1984) it all began, when Apple Inc. introduced the first Macintosh computer to the world. Back then, it was a groundbreaking moment, as the Macintosh was one of the first personal computers to feature a graphical user interface and a mouse. This revolutionary approach to computing changed the game and set the stage for the user-friendly devices we know and love today.


### The Mac's I have used

Because of my dad's (many thanks to him) job as an IT professional, our home always had a variety of Mac computers. I can vividly recall many of them. At the age of 7, I had my very own computer in my bedroom. Initially, it lacked internet connectivity, but as we entered the PowerPC era, we eventually had internet access at home. This sparked a profound interest in technology and played a pivotal role in shaping where I am today.


#### Macintosh SE30

First computer.


#### Macintosh LC

Cycled through a few Macintosh LC's every year.


#### Macintosh Portable

First laptop. Still have this Mac somewhere in the attic. Last time I tried to boot it up the small battery (for time and stuff) was stuck and not working anymore.


#### iMac G3 Bondi

The era of colourful Mac's started.


#### iMac G3 Graphite

Could see inside and see the components. Very cool!


#### Power Mac G3

#### Power Mac G4 Cube

I hope they bring a Cube form factor Mac back into the line up. Mac Studio would be the perfect candidate for it.


#### iMac G4

Most stunning iMac ever.


#### iBook G4

#### Mac mini G4

Till this day I still use Mac mini's.


#### Mac mini Intel

#### iMac Intel Unibody Late 2009

First Mac I bought with my own money. iMac 21.5" Core2Duo 3.06GHz, 4GB RAM, 1TB Disk, Radeon HD 4670


#### MacBook Air Mid 2012

#### MacBook Air Retina 2018

The transition to Retina display was mind blowing at the time. Never go back from that.


#### Mac mini M1

Circled back to a Mac mini. The transition to Apple Silicon Mac's is amazing. It blew new life into the Mac division of Apple.


#### Next one?

Probably a Mac Studio with an Apple Studio Display.


### The future

I'm hopeful for another 40 years of the Mac. With the immense success of the iPhone, the Mac seemed to take a back seat for a while. 
It's reassuring to witness the shift to Apple Silicon, which has brought the Mac back into the spotlight. 

Also curious to see what role the Apple Vision Pro will play in the future of Mac. 
The constant evolution of Apple's technology keeps us on our toes, and I'm excited 
to see how this new addition will contribute to the Mac's journey in the years to come.

Here's to more years of innovation and success for our beloved Mac!
