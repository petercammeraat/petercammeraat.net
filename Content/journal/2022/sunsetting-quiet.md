*Update 2023/01/19: [Quiet 4.0 and a commitment](/journal/2023/quiet-4-0-and-a-commitment/)*

Dear Quiet user,

Unfortunately the time has come to say goodbye to Quiet. It served us all for almost 6 years. In that time I enjoyed the feedback you have given. I tried out multiple ways to make enough revenue to sustain the app without selling your data or show annoying ads. This however is really hard and did not work out in the end.

Quiet will be removed from the App Store on 1 June 2022. The app will still work after deletion from the App Store but can't be updated anymore.

My recommendations for replacing Quiet are [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io) and [Little Snitch](https://obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html).

Thank you for the time you have been a Quiet user.

Farewell,

Peter
