In the coming months I am going to publish a lot of notes and links I collected over the years, mainly about User Experience, Privacy, Apple, Books and Tech. I started storing this in 2006, so much content to go through before I can publish it. Probably will do year by year. This explains why "old" content will appear on my website.


```
print("Hello World")
```

> A "Hello, World!" program generally is a computer program that outputs or displays the message "Hello, World!". Such a program is very simple in most programming languages, and is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. It is often the first program written by people learning to code. It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it.
