So, [I do not have have a smartphone](../../2021/i-do-not-have-a-smartphone/) anymore..

After a while I missed listening to music and podcasts; therefore, I bought an iPod Classic. 
To my delight I discovered that syncing music and podcast still works ðŸ˜€ this is an excellent
user experience of an old product that still works with the latest macOS version.


Download podcasts in the Apple Podcast app:

When you hookup an iPod it will appear in Finder, there you can sync podcasts with the iPod:

To the Apple engineers that build iPod support into Finder, ðŸ¥³ thank you!
