In the book, McKeown argues that in order to lead a successful and fulfilling life, it is important to focus on the things that are truly essential and to eliminate distractions and unnecessary commitments. He suggests that by becoming an "essentialist," or someone who is disciplined in their pursuit of fewer but better things, we can make better choices, achieve greater clarity and impact, and live a more fulfilling life.

> “The life of an Essentialist is a life lived without regret. If you have correctly identified what really matters, if you invest your time and energy in it, then it is difficult to regret the choices you make. You become proud of the life you have chosen to live.” 

> “Sleep will enhance your ability to explore, make connections, and do less but better throughout your waking hours.” 

> “What do I feel deeply inspired by?” and “What am I particularly talented at?” and “What meets a significant need in the world?”
