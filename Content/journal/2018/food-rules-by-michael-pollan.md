The book presents a set of simple, easy-to-follow rules for eating well and avoiding processed foods. The rules are based on traditional diets and aim to help readers navigate the modern food landscape. The book is divided into three sections: "What should I eat?" "What kind of food should I eat?" and "How should I eat?" and it's goal is to give people a simple and practical guide to eating healthy.

> “Don’t eat anything your great-grandmother wouldn’t recognize as food.” 

> “...There's a lot of money in the Western diet. The more you process any food, the more profitable it becomes. The healthcare industry makes more money treating chronic diseases (which account for three quarters of the $2 trillion plus we spend each year on health care in this country) than preventing them. ” 

> “What an extraordinary achievement for a civilization: to have developed the one diet that reliably makes its people sick!”
