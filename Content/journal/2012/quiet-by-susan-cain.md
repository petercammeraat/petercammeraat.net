The book argues that introverts are often overlooked and undervalued in a culture that values extroverts, and it explores the ways in which introverts can use their natural strengths and abilities to achieve success and happiness. The book covers a wide range of topics, including the history of introversion, the science behind it, and practical advice for introverts on how to thrive in a world that is often geared toward extroverts.

> “Introverts, in contrast, may have strong social skills and enjoy parties and business meetings, but after a while wish they were home in their pajamas. They prefer to devote their social energies to close friends, colleagues, and family. They listen more than they talk, think before they speak, and often feel as if they express themselves better in writing than in conversation. They tend to dislike conflict. Many have a horror of small talk, but enjoy deep discussions.”

> “There's zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas.”

> “So stay true to your own nature. If you like to do things in a slow and steady way, don't let others make you feel as if you have to race. If you enjoy depth, don't force yourself to seek breadth. If you prefer single-tasking to multi-tasking, stick to your guns. Being relatively unmoved by rewards gives you the incalculable power to go your own way.”
