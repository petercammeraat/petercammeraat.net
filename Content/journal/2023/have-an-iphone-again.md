[Almost 2 years ago](/journal/2021/i-do-not-have-a-smartphone/) I stopped using my iPhone and Apple Watch.

In recent weeks I bought an iPhone because I missed the camera and the Photo app too much. I am very happy to have them back in my life.
Tried all kinds of substitute but they are simply not available or good enough.
