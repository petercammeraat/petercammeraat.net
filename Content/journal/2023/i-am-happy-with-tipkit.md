Over the years I became more convinced that onboarding flows were users are educated are not working. 
It is much better to educate people in context and when needed.

This is where TipKit comes in.

You can create Tips. Decide where to display them. Make rules when they need to be displayed.
When an user already used a functionality TipKit does not show the Tip linked to that functionality.
Also synced across devices with iCloud.

Nice [WWDC session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/) to watch.
