I listen for a few years now to the podcast Under the Radar. It is about developing apps as an indie developer. Highly recommended to add to your podcast app if you have any interest in developing apps.

This episode is named "Don’t Run Servers". It is about thinking outside the box and not default to use a server for some functionality. Often it is not needed at all.
