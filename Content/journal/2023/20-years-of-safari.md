Safari was introduced in Mac OS X Panther on January 7, 2003. It was also included with the first generation iPhone, which was released in 2007. At the time of its release, Safari was known for being the fastest browser on the Mac.

Today marks the 20th anniversary of Safari ü•≥

From the [press release](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2003/01/07Apple-Unveils-Safari/):

> Safari‚Äôs highly-tuned rendering engine loads pages over three times faster than Microsoft‚Äôs Internet Explorer for the Mac and runs Javascript over twice as fast. Safari‚Äôs innovative features include Google search capabilities integrated directly into the toolbar; SnapBack, a new way to instantly snap back up to search results or the top level of any website after browsing down one or more levels; a completely new way to name, organize and present bookmarks; and automatic ‚Äúpop-up‚Äù ad blocking.

> ‚ÄúSafari is the fastest browser on the Mac, and we predict that many will feel it is the best browser ever created,‚Äù said Steve Jobs, Apple‚Äôs CEO. ‚ÄúWe are bringing innovation back into this category with the first all new browser created in many years.‚Äù

Safari is the underdog in a world dominated by Google Chrome. An underdog I keep using! 

There are several reasons why you might choose to use Safari as your web browser:

1. Speed: Safari is known for being fast and responsive, which can make browsing the web a more enjoyable experience.
2. Energy efficiency: Safari is designed to use less energy than other browsers, which can be especially beneficial if you use your laptop or desktop computer for long periods of time.
3. Integration with Apple ecosystem: If you use other Apple products and services, such as iCloud or the Keychain password manager, Safari can be a convenient choice because it integrates seamlessly with these tools.
4. Privacy: Safari includes a number of privacy features, such as Intelligent Tracking Prevention, that can help protect your online activity from being tracked by third parties.
5. Security: Safari is regularly updated to protect against security vulnerabilities, so you can feel confident that your browsing experience is secure.


My hope is that Safari will continue to be a strong and viable web browser in the future. In an age where online privacy and security are increasingly important, it's important for Safari to continue to innovate and provide users with the tools they need to protect themselves from tracking and other online threats. I hope that Safari will continue to be a strong competitor to Chrome and other browsers.
