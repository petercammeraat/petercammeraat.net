### How a habit of self-reflection could help improve your career

> I think my life has been a reasonably unique and unusual one. Now in my early forties, I've had careers as an opera singer, a Catholic priest, a corporate lawyer, and now, a management consultant.

> Through all of these changes, through all of these careers, one constant has been present: the practice of reflection. Now people may think that reflection is something that happens in a dark, private room by candlelight or flashlight, to purge one's deepest, darkest secrets. But I want to bring this practice out of the dark and into the light. I want to share how this practice can help our everyday lives, and especially our work lives. I want to share how this practice helps to improve performance, to make better decisions, both big and small, and to build better relationships.
