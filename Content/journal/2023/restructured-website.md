I have made some changes to my website's structure. Specifically, I have combined the Writings, Linked, Reading, and Projects sections into a single section called Journal. I have also removed several Linked entries and organised the tags more effectively. These changes have created a better system for future writing. Overall, my website is now more organised and clean, which makes me quite pleased with the outcome. ðŸ˜ƒ

I invested time in transferring my website from Netlify to my own VPS. I plan on creating a guide on how to do this in the future. My main motivation for doing this is to promote the decentralised web. By hosting my website on a large platform, I contribute to the centralisation of the web, which goes against my beliefs.
