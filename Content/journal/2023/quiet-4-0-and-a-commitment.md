TLDR: Quiet 4.0 is a restart of Quiet and a commitment to support it for the next 10 years.


Last May I [stopped updating Quiet](/journal/2022/sunsetting-quiet/) and pulled it from the App Store. Shutdown my own company to focus on my job and grow. Besides the monetary reasons I also was tired in that period, it was good decision to take a break.

Between now and then I grew as a person. I have gained a lot of knowledge and skills at my job. In addition, I have learned how to manage my time effectively and create a better balance between work, study, personal projects, social interactions with friends and loved ones, and time spent with family. Through this, I have been able to achieve a greater level of balance and fulfilment in my life.

Removing Quiet from the App Store was a decision that I now regret. The app provided value and utility to a large number of users, and I continue to receive emails from users who found it helpful. In December, I began to miss the app and began experimenting with it again. With the abundance of unwanted chatbots, pop-up newsletter prompts, and push notification alerts on various websites, I realised the importance of a tool like Quiet in helping individuals control their digital noise.

In the last 48 hours I republished Quiet again in the App Store, submitted a cleaned up version to Apple, and released it.

Quiet is now available for free, but users have the option to make a donation if they choose to. My primary objective has shifted from generating revenue to helping as many people as possible to reduce the overwhelming noise on the internet. I would greatly appreciate it if you could spread the word to your friends and let them know about this useful tool.

I want to assure all of the users of Quiet that I am fully committed to supporting the app for the next 10 years. I understand that my previous decision to remove the app from the App Store may have caused disappointment and mistrust among some users. I hope that by republishing the app and committing to its long-term support, I will be able to regain your trust and provide you with a valuable tool for managing digital noise.
