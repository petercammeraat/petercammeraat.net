I loved how during the WWDC Keynote and The State of Union not once the term AI was used. AI is an hype word and could mean a lot of things. 
Love how Apple keeps saying "On Device Machine Learning". It is important because a lot of other tech companies send your data to a server somewhere and do machine learning on server.
It is impressive that Apple keeps doing it on device and that often it is invisible to the user.

Have an idea for an app that is going to use on device machine learning to give better recommendations to users.
Cannot wait to dive deep into it.
