### Why block & hide Newsletter popups/banners/alerts?

Newsletters popups, banners, and alerts can be incredibly distracting for users when browsing the internet, making it hard for them to focus on the main purpose of a website. To make the browsing experience faster, smoother, and more enjoyable, it is recommended to block and hide these elements. By doing so, users can access the website without being interrupted by unnecessary distractions, allowing them to make the most of their time and achieve their goals faster and more efficiently.
