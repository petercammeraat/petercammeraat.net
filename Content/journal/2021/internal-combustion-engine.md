> The invention of the internal combustion engine in the 19th century has revolutionized transportation over land, water, and air. Despite their omnipresence in modern day, the operation of an engine may be cryptic. Over the course of this article I’d like to explain the functionality of all the basic engine parts shown in the demonstration below.

> It’s hard to talk about a mechanical device without visualizing its motion, so many demonstrations in this blog post are animated.
> An engine like this may seem complicated, but we will build it up from first principles. In fact, we’ll start with a significantly simpler way of generating a rotational motion.

Awesome explanation about Internal Combustion Engine. I am a big fan of Bartosz Ciechanowski work, his explanations are clear and have cool interactive examples.
