> From fonts to animated movies, curves and surfaces constitute fundamental building blocks of many geometrical designs. Over the course of this blog post I’ll explain how this model of a mask can be very smooth despite being described by a limited number of small points • that you can drag around to change the mask’s shape.

> Throughout this article I’ll keep jumping back and forth between curves and surfaces to highlight how the ideas we develop for wiggly lines can be expanded onto three dimensional shells that we can shape.

Awesome explanation about Curves and Surfaces. I am a big fan of Bartosz Ciechanowski work, his explanations are clear and have cool interactive examples.
