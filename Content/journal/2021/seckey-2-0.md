SecKey is rebuild from the ground up with SwiftUI - a new technology from Apple for building apps with a bright future in front of it. Rebuilding the app will make maintenance and adding new features a lot easier.

This results in an app that ready for the future. Less crash prone and more reliable on both macOS and iOS. Can not wait to see what is coming next to SecKey.

Also finally there is a visual countdown timer for every one time password.

Thank you for using [SecKey](../../../projects/seckey/) and for all the feedback and support you have given :-)
