### What is Apple Silicon?

During WWDC 2020, Apple announced a plan to transition Mac computers to Apple-designed processors dubbed Apple Silicon, shifting away from the Intel CPUs that have been at the core of the Mac lineup since 2005.

In November 2020, Apple launched the first Macs with the brand new M1 chip - the MacBook Air, 13" MacBook Pro and Mac Mini.
