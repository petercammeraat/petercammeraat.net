iMok is intended as a kind of notepad to record what your colleagues or friends drink: coffee with milk, two lumps of sugar or maybe just black. 

When you start iMok you will see a screen with two tabs: coffee and tea. With each tab you have the option to indicate new people and their drink preference. 

This works quite simply: just a text box in which you enter 'tea with sugar' or 'rooibos tea'.


Note: iMok is no longer available in the App Store. It was in the App Store for 2 years.


### Technology
iMok was the first app I build for the iPhone. Written in Objective-C using UIKit, Foundation, and CoreData.
