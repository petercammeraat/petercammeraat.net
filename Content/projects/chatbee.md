ChatBee was a service, which you could use to create a secure chatbox and share the box with the people you want to speak.

Note: the webapp is no longer available. It went offline in 2013.

### Technology
My role in this project was the design and front-end development. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript was handcrafted, no frameworks used.
