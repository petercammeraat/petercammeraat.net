Quiet is a content blocker for Safari on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Vision Pro that lets you block out all of the unwanted distractions and focus.

[![Download Quiet on the App Store](/assets/buttons/download-app-store-black.svg)](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1441525727?pt=119418684&ct=ProductPage&mt=8)

Quiet on Mac has a super power, too. The ability to block distractions system-wide and not just those found in Safari. Want to prevent the Twitter app from getting in the way of your work or Chrome from being your go-to crutch? Quiet can help! You'll be safe from your most troublesome distractions and free to use your Mac for something more productive.

We all have work that needs to get done but we also have access to the world's knowledge at our fingertips. Sometimes that gets in the way, whether it's a Wikipedia rabbit hole or the latest TikTok trends. Quiet can block those websites and more so you can get your work done without distraction.

Quiet can block access to some of the biggest sources of distraction on the internet including:

- Facebook
- Twitter
- Instagram
- YouTube
- TikTok
- Reddit
- And so much more!


Quiet doesn't just block websites you don't want to visit, though. It can block some of the most irritating parts of the websites you need to visit as well. Block notification popups, chat bubbles, share buttons, and more all from one app.

Automate Quiet by changing rules depending on the circumstance using Shortcuts. Block specific websites while you're working and others while you're off.

It's time to reclaim your Safari browsing experience. It's time the internet was just a little more Quiet.

Note: Quiet does not block ads on the webpages you visit.


### 5 Star Review

> It’s sad that the internet has gotten to the point where an app like Quiet is needed - but here we are... I appreciate that Quiet strikes the balance of blocking prying eyes but allowing ads. As annoying as ads are they are the necessary evil to keep your favorite websites afloat. I have this app installed on all my devices and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a bit of sanity back when using the web, especially social media skeptics like myself. Also, the devs are highly responsive to feedback and suggestions. They’re good people. Requests: the ability to block TikTok and Baidu would be greatly appreciated.
