Hi, I am Peter Cammeraat. This is my space on the internet. I build software with Swift.

In my free time I like to read, swim, walk long distances, play offline games, make photos, and listen to podcast. 

My main interests are Swift, software, user experience, and privacy.

#### Resume 
##### Own projects
May 2016 - today

Building software with Swift. Check the [projects page](/projects/) for a full list of projects I worked on. I am the most proud of [Quiet](https://petercammeraat.net/projects/quiet/), an app that helped people to stay focused and unlearn bad habits.


##### The Digital Club
November 2021 - today 

I started as junior iOS Developer for [The Digital Club](https://thedigitalclub.nl). In one year I grew to a medior iOS Developer and started designing. 

Launched one app, worked continuously on 3 other apps, continued building a framework that integrates in apps for Airlines (Lufthansa for example). Designed 3 apps on my own and helped out with several other apps.

2024: the team I am in changed it's name from iOS team to Swift team, indicating an interest to take Swift and use it on other platforms. Also the company name changed from Coffee IT to The Digital Club, this in an effort to provide more services for our clients.


##### Hospbit
December 2012 - December 2015

Together with a few friends we build [Hospbit](/projects/hospbit/), a SaaS tool that made tracking maintenance of buildings easier. We started with a pilot project in Hotel Casa. I was responsible for the front-end development, design and product owner.


##### Hotel Casa
October 2011 - December 2020

Working with guests and colleagues helped me grow as a person. At the end of my employment I was a supervisor of the Front Office, member of guest experience team, helped the hotel switch from window pc's to Mac's which lowered the IT budget immensely.


##### Freelance web design/development work
May 2006 - November 2011

I worked for a few different companies, to name two: [Osage](https://osage.nl) and [AdamsYoung](https://adamsyoung.nl) (now it is called Eresults). Also had my own clients. Made new web designs, did front-end work, styled newsletters and more work that had to do with web development.
